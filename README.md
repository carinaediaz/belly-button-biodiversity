# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview
##### We assisted Roza with creating a dashboard that visualizes the results of her case-study where samples of bacteria were taken from the partcipant's belly buttons to hopefully identify the next best bacteria for synthesizing the taste of beef. 
##### Our final dashboard was customized to contain a background image on the jumbotron, custom color themes, background colors, and fonts.
